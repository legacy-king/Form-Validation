# Form Validation Project

A practice project for learning client-side form validation using vanilla JavaScript, built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates comprehensive form validation with real-time user feedback. It includes validation for multiple input types including email, dropdown selections, text inputs, and password matching.

## ✨ Features

- **Live validation feedback** - Fields are validated when the user leaves them (on blur)
- **Custom error messages** - Clear, user-friendly error messages for each validation rule
- **Visual indicators** - Green borders for valid fields, red borders for invalid fields
- **Email format validation** - Uses regex to ensure proper email structure
- **Password strength requirements** - Minimum 8 characters
- **Password confirmation matching** - Ensures passwords match before submission
- **Success feedback** - High five message when form is successfully submitted

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ Classes)

## 📋 Form Fields

1. **Email** - Validates proper email format (user@domain.com)
2. **Country** - Dropdown selection (required)
3. **Postal Code** - Minimum 5 characters
4. **Password** - Minimum 8 characters
5. **Confirm Password** - Must match password field

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `form-validation.html` in your browser
3. Try filling out the form with both valid and invalid data to see the validation in action

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to use the `novalidate` attribute to implement custom validation
- Working with blur and submit events for validation timing
- Using regular expressions for pattern matching (email validation)
- Managing form state and user feedback with JavaScript classes
- Best practices for user experience in form validation
- CSS pseudo-classes for styling valid/invalid states

## 🎓 Assignment

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project's [Form Validation lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-form-validation).

## 📝 Future Improvements

- [ ] Add more sophisticated password requirements (uppercase, numbers, special characters)
- [ ] Implement country-specific postal code validation
- [ ] Add password strength indicator
- [ ] Include form data submission to a backend API
- [ ] Add accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, screen reader support)
